## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within M2ARM, please send an email to [security@m2arm.dev](mailto:security@m2arm.dev). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Your assessment of the potential impact
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions of M2ARM are affected
- **Environment**: Operating system, architecture, and other relevant details
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a minimal proof of concept

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate and validate the report
3. **Fix Development**: We will work on developing a fix for confirmed vulnerabilities
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Release**: Security fixes will be released as soon as possible

### Security Considerations

M2ARM handles potentially sensitive operations including:

- **Code Analysis**: Scanning source code for patterns
- **File Modifications**: Modifying source files during migration
- **Binary Execution**: Running and testing compiled binaries
- **Network Operations**: Downloading dependencies and tools

### Best Practices for Users

When using M2ARM:

1. **Review Changes**: Always review migration changes before applying them
2. **Backup Data**: Create backups before running migrations
3. **Isolated Testing**: Test migrations in isolated environments first
4. **Dependency Verification**: Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies
5. **Least Privilege**: Run M2ARM with minimal necessary permissions

### Security Features

M2ARM includes several security features:

- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes before applying them
- **Automatic Backups**: Create backups before modifications
- **Sandboxed Testing**: Support for containerized testing environments
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and file paths
- **Secure Defaults**: Use secure configuration defaults

### Known Security Considerations

- **Cross-Compilation Toolchains**: Users must trust the cross-compilation toolchains they install
- **Container Execution**: ARM testing may require container execution with elevated privileges
- **Code Injection**: Be cautious when using M2ARM on untrusted source code
- **Supply Chain**: Verify the authenticity of M2ARM releases and dependencies

### CVE Information

We will assign CVE identifiers for confirmed security vulnerabilities when appropriate and work with relevant databases to ensure proper tracking.

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released through:

- GitHub Releases with security tags
- Security advisories on GitHub
- Email notifications to registered users (when available)
- Updates to this security policy

### Contact Information

- **Security Email**: [security@m2arm.dev](mailto:security@m2arm.dev)
- **General Contact**: [team@m2arm.dev](mailto:team@m2arm.dev)
